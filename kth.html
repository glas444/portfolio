            <h3 id="AGI">Advanced Graphics and Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              In the course DH2413 Advanced Graphics and Interaction (AGI) I
              collaborated with a small group of fellow students during two
              separate projects, to produce interactive and graphically engaging
              experiences. Two games were produced: Marball and Nightmar.
              Marball is a puzzle game featuring a novel approach to the
              tabletop game Labyrinth, featuring physical items and a pivoting
              mechanism in order to control a virtual game board. Nightmar is a
              Virtual Reality (VR) game which allows spectators to interact with
              the game, aiding the main player through call-outs by viewing the
              gameplay from a separate screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first project, named Marball, was designed from the ground up
              to be run on a specially designed table by Samsung called the
              Pixelsense. It is a TV-screen mounted on the top of a table. The
              table also features five near-infrared (IR) cameras which can
              detect phycons placed upon the table. The table was put on top of
              a wooden board with a knob centred underneath. This allowed the
              table to be tilted. However, since the table was not meant to be
              pivoted, there was no internal gyroscopic tracking available.
              Hence, an application was developed for a connected phone to
              handle the acceleration. Hand Sized 3D-printed objects were also
              crafted to interact with the virtual world through the
              IR-scanning. When placed on the table, virtual objects appeared on
              the game board to help the marble get to the goal post. These
              included a magnet, a wall, objects for resizing and a turbine fan.

            <p>
              The second project, called Nightmar, was developed as a VR
              experience with the added requirement that spectators would be
              able to participate. The spectators would be able to view the
              in-game world through some virtual window and be able to interact
              or aid the main player. Inspired by Five Nights at Freddys and
              Amnesia, the team developed a VR horror game where the player
              walked around an abandoned mansion, while trying to collect keys
              to open the front gate and escape. A monster was implemented,
              which featured a pathing system to roam the mansion, but would
              also attack the player on sight. A CCTV camera system was
              developed for the spectators, where they could shift through a
              number of different views of the building, aiding the player with
              an unobstructed and clearer view of the rooms. See more details
              about the project on our webpage

            <h3 id="CGD">Computer Game Design</h3>
            <p>
              In this course, I worked together with a team of fellow students
              to develop a video game using the GODOT engine. The course allowed
              students to learn the foundation of game design and investigate
              the different aspects that make up video games. The theme and type
              of game were up to the students to decide, which meant a lot of
              creative freedom was present. This also meant teamwork, since all
              decisions were democracy based.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game itself is a 2D roguelike top-down adventure game. It has
              a progression based system allowing the character to gain perks as
              they explore the world. You can collect wood and stone in order to
              craft and build to protect from monsters. See more at the
              <a href="https://emma1565.wixsite.com/marball">website</a>

            <h3 id="CGI">Computer Graphics and Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              In this course I got an introduction to rasterizing, ray tracing,
              and other techniques used in games, such as proxy meshes, bounding
              volumes for collision checking etc. At the end of the course I
              also worked on a project with two friends, where we built a
              navier-stokes fluid dynamics simulation using C++. Visit the
              <a href="https://github.com/lnoharet/dgi">GitHub page</a>

              to test the fluid simuliation yourself!

            <h3 id="IV">Information Visualisation</h3>
            <p>
              Information Visualisation was all about teaching us students how
              to properly present data to be readable to the user. To understand
              what is needed to be shown but not overwhelm nor present
              unnessisary information. The course allowed the students to work
              with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and visualisation tools such as D3 and
              VEGA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course ultimately lead up to a project which tasked the
              students to create an interactive data transformation website. My
              team and I created a webpage to display information about the
              current METAcraft Minecraft Server, at the time, available to KTH
              students. The website had a SQL server backend communicating with
              the hosted Minecraft server and displayed the information on the
              webpage for an interactive frontend experience. As of the current
              day, the webpage has been put offline but all code is still
              availiable on the public

              <a href="https://github.com/lnoharet/metaweb">github</a>.

            <h3 id="DEEP">Deep Learning in Data Scienec</h3>
            <p>
              In the DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science course, I got to learn
              about computer vision, convolutional networks and recurrent
              networks, as well as optimisation on training with different
              dataset. At the end of the course, I worked with two friends to
              develop a CNN computer vision implementation from the ground up.
              In other words, create a CNN without using any machine learning
              packages. This was made to ultimatly classify a image based
              dataset, specifically the OXFORD-IIIT Pet dataset. Everything is
              documented in the associated

              <a href="https://github.com/lnoharet/DeepProject/">github</a>.
